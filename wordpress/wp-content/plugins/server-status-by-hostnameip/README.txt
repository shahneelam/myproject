If you have a server or more than one servers, then you might want to display a status of your server on your website so that people would know whether your server is UP or Down. We have made you a plugin from which you can do that in some clicks. Our Plugin sends a request to all these servers to check if they are listening on the specific port which you'll mentioned while adding the server. If it's up and listening it will turn green and if the server isn't up or isn't listening on that specific port it will turn to red which means the server is not listening on that port. That means you can add different ports to check which services on your server are running. if any of these gone down, it will show you the status also in the admin panel and where ever you will place the shortcode or widget. This Plugin also tells you the server load whether its running on windows or linux.
